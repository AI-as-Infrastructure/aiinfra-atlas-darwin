# ATLAS REMOTE STAGING ENVIRONMENT GRACEFUL STOP
#=============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE:
#   This script gracefully stops the remote staging environment services while
#   preserving data and configurations for potential restart.
# 
# USAGE:
#   ./deploy/staging/scripts/stop_staging_remote.sh
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - config/.env.staging file must exist locally (copied to /tmp/.env.staging)
#   - SSH access to the staging server
#
#=============================================================================
